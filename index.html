  <h3>Most of these you may already know about me, here's a few more on the infamous me!<h3>
  <p>My name is Hawa, and my name means 'air' in the Indian and Arabic language. I have a pet cat named Paka, and she's the fluffiest thing I know. I'm currently attending Code Fellows and I'm hoping I can gain some skills in full stack web developing here. I majored in Education (Early Childhood and Elementary to be more specific) at Central Washington University.</p>
