    <h3>You may feel like you already know me, but here's a few token information about the incredible, ever glorious, and the bad-ass-coder you've been eyeing!<h3>

    <p><span>My name</span> is Hawa, and it means 'air' in both Hindi and Arabic. <span>I have a pet</span> cat named Gaara (yup, named after Gaara from Naruto), and he's the fluffiest thing you'll ever see. I am currently attending <span>Code Fellows</span> and I'm hoping I can gain some skills in full-stack web development here. I majored in <span>Education</span> (Early Childhood and Elementary to be more specific) from <span>Central Washington University</span>, so I hope that comes in handy one day.</p>
